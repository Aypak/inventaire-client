Make, give, get from a gift, lend, borrow, rent, buy, sell, upcycle, recycle... **This is about mapping possibilities and alternatives to plain old consumerism, where information is opaque by default: transparency, open data, the transmission of data from the vendor to the customer must become the rule**.",
    "pitch-just-books": "That's already a wide program isn't it? **Let's start small: just mapping books in your network or nearby**, available for giving, lending or selling. Peer to peer first, but integrating local libraries and local booksellers in the map as soon as possible.",

What if our daily interactions with resources, our transactions, were contributing to make everyone's knowledge on those resources grow? **Inventaire is an experiment to make a step in this direction**, starting by using **[Wikidata](http://wikidata.org/)** - the awesome public database gathering facts for Wikipedia - as a starting point to gather data on resources. All public data gathered in Inventaire will be published under an open licence.",

Trust comes from the possibilty always opened to take what was built together and continue somewhere else, that's why **[Inventaire's code](http://github.com/maxlath/inventaire/) is a Free/Open software published under the [AGPL3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html)**. Today, the Inventaire experiment has a centralized technical architecture as decentralized architectures are hard to achieve: efforts are focused on bringing users value from open knowledge with as little pain as possible, but finding ways to overcome this centralization is part of the trip.",
